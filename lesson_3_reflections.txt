When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keep all your work local?
I would want to create a remote repository in tthree situations: 
a) I am sharing that repository with a group of people also working on my project
b) I cannot work from the same computer all of the time, and wish to find a practical way to synchronize data between computers
c) For backup purposes, the project is not stored on one local computer only (and it can be retrieved from a remote source)
