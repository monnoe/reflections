1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Initializing a repository creates a new hidden file within the directory ".git/"
This file is the repository that will collect all the information necessary to tag and follow the files within the repository.
It is currently empty, since GIT gives the user the freedom to add whichever existing files he or she wants to the repository (no automatic assumptions)
